Braille

A simple braille text editor

I renamed each file to represent it's target OS and removed the version number from the filename.
I added some comments to make the project easier to follow.
I still have a lot of code to fix.  (Did I really not initialize my variables at declaration?  Was that normal in the 90's, or was I just a bad programmer?)
I plan on moving file opening to main() for scope reasons, and moving code common to both programs into a header file.
